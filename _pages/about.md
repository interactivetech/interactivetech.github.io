Hi there, thanks for visiting my blog! My name is Andrew and I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer in the DC Metro Area. My passions and expertise are in machine learning, computer vision, and augmented reality. 

This blog is a record of all the ideas and side projects that keep me busy when I am not working. Hopefully this will inspire others and connect me to other developers and entrepeneurs interested in these areas.
